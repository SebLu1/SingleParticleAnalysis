[[55814,1],0]: A high-performance Open MPI point-to-point messaging module
was unable to find any relevant network interfaces:

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.

 Auto-refine: Estimated accuracy angles= 28.28 degrees; offsets= 5.67 Angstroms
 Auto-refine: WARNING: The angular accuracy is worse than 10 degrees, so basically you cannot align your particles (yet)!
 Auto-refine: WARNING: You probably need not worry if the accuracy improves during the next few iterations.
 Auto-refine: WARNING: However, if the problem persists it may lead to spurious FSC curves, so be wary of inflated resolution estimates...
 Auto-refine: WARNING: Sometimes it is better to tune resolution yourself by adjusting T in a 3D-classification with a single class.

 Auto-refine: Estimated accuracy angles= 10.02 degrees; offsets= 3.366 Angstroms
 Auto-refine: WARNING: The angular accuracy is worse than 10 degrees, so basically you cannot align your particles (yet)!
 Auto-refine: WARNING: You probably need not worry if the accuracy improves during the next few iterations.
 Auto-refine: WARNING: However, if the problem persists it may lead to spurious FSC curves, so be wary of inflated resolution estimates...
 Auto-refine: WARNING: Sometimes it is better to tune resolution yourself by adjusting T in a 3D-classification with a single class.
